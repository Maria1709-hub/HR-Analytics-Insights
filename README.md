# HR-Analytics-Insights
### Title
**HR Analytics Project**

### Summary
This project focused on analyzing a real-time HR dataset to extract meaningful insights and showcase data analysis skills. Using Power BI and guided by a YouTube tutorial from Codebasics, I transformed raw attendance data into actionable insights. The analysis addressed key HR challenges such as identifying frequent leave-takers, work-from-home patterns, and monthly attendance trends. By cleaning and visualizing data, I demonstrated the ability to provide valuable solutions for business decision-making.

### Problem Statement
The HR professional, Pinali, faced challenges in analyzing attendance data to answer critical questions such as:
- How many employees frequently take leaves?
- How many employees work from home or partially work from home?
- Which months have the highest and lowest employee presence?
- What are the reasons behind employee absences?

### Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project was an attendance sheet for 2022, covering the months of April, May, and June. It was provided in Excel format and contained vast and unstructured data spread across multiple worksheets. The dataset was downloaded using a link provided in the tutorial video.

### Tools and Techniques Used
1. **Power BI:** Used for data import, transformation, and visualization.
2. **Power Query:** Employed to clean and structure the raw data for analysis.
3. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized to create custom measures for deeper insights.
4. **Visualizations:** Included tables, pie charts, graphs, and slicers to represent insights effectively.

### Methodology
1. **Data Import and Cleaning:**
   - Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI using the "Get Data" option.
   - Transformed unstructured data into a clean and usable format using Power Query.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Consolidated data spread across multiple worksheets into a single structured format.
   - Applied cleaning techniques to remove inconsistencies and prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Measure Creation:**
   - Created custom measures using DAX formulas.
   - Stored these measures in a separate table to organize calculations effectively.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Used Power BIâ€™s visualization tools to create insights.
   - Represented data through tables, pie charts, graphs, and slicers to answer specific HR queries.

### Key Insights
1. Identified employees frequently taking leaves.
2. Analyzed patterns in work-from-home and hybrid work arrangements.
3. Determined months with the highest and lowest employee attendance.
4. Provided possible reasons for absences based on attendance trends.

### Conclusion
This project transformed raw attendance data into actionable insights, addressing Pinali's concerns and helping the organization optimize its HR strategies. It showcases the power of data analytics tools like Power BI to solve real-world business challenges. The step-by-step process of cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data demonstrates my ability to handle complex datasets and deliver meaningful insights.

This project is a testament to my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
